# Plasma

Since watching the movie _Hackers_, I've loved the aesthetics of the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). On my first computer as a ~9 year old, I had a Plasma demo that I was obsessed with. Not sure why it's taken me so long but I've now made my own.

## Running

I've rawdogged it with HTML, CSS and library-free JavaScript as God intended. Just open `index.html` in a browser, for that late-90s vibe.

## To do

[x] Basic plasma
[x] Config with sliders to change speeds and frequencies
[x] Some basic nice presets
[ ] Config to change color palette
[ ] Allow inputting different frequency functions
